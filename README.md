We propose this workshop at the MexIHC 2024 to convene academic and industry professionals interested in exchanging viewpoints and approaches on how Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more specifically, Generative Artificial Intelligence can be accounted for in responsible yet productive ways when designing courses and lessons in the multidisciplinary field of Human-Computer Interaction. At the workshop, we will discuss the participants’ experiences and perspectives, and also will conduct a practical activity to codesign HCI lessons while keeping responsible AI in mind. Ultimately, we aim to facilitate the development of a new community around the topic of Responsible AI in HCI Education.

## Aim of the workshop<br> 
This workshop aims to gather interested parties with three main goals:
<ol>(1) to exchange knowledge on issues and good practices around the use, design, evaluation, and educational strategies of human and socially responsible AI.</ol>
<ol>(2) to codesign techno-pedagogical strategies. to promote ethical awareness on responsible AI issues in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) courses.</ol>
<ol>(3) to build a new community of interested parties at the intersection of HCI, AI and other related fields (e.g., sociology, anthropology, law, business, health, etc.).</ol>

## Topics of interest<br> 
Submissions for discussion during the Workshop can cover one or more topics related to Responsible AI in HCI Education, including but not limited to the following:
<ul>- AI-Generated HCI educational content.</ul>
<ul>- Equitable AI: gender, ethnicity/ race, age, (dis)ability, and socio-economics diversity in human+AI collaborative design, use and evaluation.</ul>
<ul>- Ethical awareness qualitative assessment.</ul>
<ul>- Ethical data and AI literacy interventions.</ul>
<ul>- Ethical design and evaluation of technology.</ul>
<ul>- Ethical issues and considerations on human+AI collaboration for teaching or learning purposes.</ul>
<ul>- Ethical use of GenAI tools in HCI research.</ul>
<ul>- Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics (FATE) as transversal educational practices in HCI programs.</ul>
<ul>- GenAI tools and collaborative learning in HCI.</ul>
<ul>- GenAI tools use for HCI curriculum development.</ul>
<ul>- Human+AI studies in Latin America.</ul>
<ul>- Human-centricity in AI governance.</ul>
<ul>- Impact of GenAI tools on HCI students’ learning.</ul>
<ul>- Impact of GenAI tools on HCI faculty’s roles and professional development.</ul>
<ul>- Instructional design on AI for HCI Education.</ul>
<ul>- Learning activities on socially responsible computing embedded into HCI courses.</ul>
<ul>- Multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary approaches for lesson planning to raise ethical awareness on data-driven or GenAI technologies across HCI courses.</ul>
<ul>- Participatory methods (e.g., codesign, action research, community-led design) applied to understand or promote (educational or research) practices changes to minimize the impact of data-driven or AI technologies for vulnerable or underrepresented populations. </ul>
<ul>- Responsible AI across HCI courses.</ul>
<ul>- Shift in the HCI educational paradigm in the GenAI tools era.</ul>
<ul>- Techno-pedagogical strategies on AI for HCI Education.</ul>

## Instructions to authors<br> 
We invite participants to submit literature reviews, field research, experience reports, position papers, calls for collaboration (e.g., research projects, courses, bootcamps, hackathons, etc.), and other types of communication, to spark discussions and collaboration. The papers submitted can be written in Spanish or English, and have an extension of 2-4 pages, including references. Presentationscan be given in Spanish, but the presentation slides should be written in English.

Organizers will select submissions for inclusion in the workshop. Selection will be based on relevance and originality, and potential for future engagement and contribution to our new community. Submissions will be subjected to anonymous peer-review by at least two experts with no conflict of interest. We anticipate a workshop size of 10 papers. In case we receive many submissions, we will recruit a program committee from known researchers and scholars who have worked at the intersection of HCI, AI and other related fields.

Communication platforms will be set up to enable engagement before, during, and after our sessions. Online tools (e.g., Slack or other real-time communication app, Google Slides) will be used to engage organizers and participants in collaborative ideation and critical discussion.

After the workshop, we expect to keep in touch with this newly built community, to collaboratively organize other activities around responsible AI in HCI education. These activities can include educational proposals or research studies, such as deepening and broadening discussions around instructional codesign for HCI classes from this workshop, a workshop or tutorial at CLIHC 2025 (12nd Latin American Conference on Human Computer Interaction), online discussion panels or lectures, summer or winter schools, and an online survey study in Mexico to understand how interested parties are using, designing and evaluating GenAI tools.

### Participants 
By interested parties we mean researchers, scholars and students of different educational levels, industry professionals, government staff, and non-governmental organization (NGO) members. Even though our focus is on discussions around responsible AI in HCI courses, interested parties from any field of knowledge are welcome to the workshop, since HCI is inherently an inter- and multidisciplinary field, and we believe this plurality of points of view can challenge common preconceptions and enrich debates on human+AI topics. We are particularly interested in learning about research projects and experiences carried out in Mexico, other Latin American countries or by Latin American interested parties working in other world regions.
